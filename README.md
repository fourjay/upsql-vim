upsql-vim
=========

Simple Auto Upcase SQL keywords for vim

*Usage*
Just type sql in any way you want. Keywords will be upcased automagically.

Uses a suggestion from vim user thread to use synIDattr() which works
regardless of any prior capitalization.

Mapped to <space> and <Cr> to trigger after each word in SQL filetypes
